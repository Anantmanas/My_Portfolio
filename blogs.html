            <p>Most of the developers use GitHub or any other Git Client in their development cycle. But have you always
                wondered what is git and why do they use it?
                In this post, let’s look at the basics of git and how easy is it to create your first repo on GitHub.
            </p>
            <h1 id="-what-is-git-"><strong>What is Git?</strong></h1>
            <p>Git is an open-source project developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds (Yes, you guessed it right, the famous
                creator of Linux Operating System). It is a <strong>Distributed Version Control System</strong>.
                That sounded like a charm straight out of J. K. Rowling’s Book. Let me explain it in muggles’ English.
            </p>
            <h3 id="-version-control-system-vcs-"><strong>Version Control System (VCS)</strong></h3>
            <p>VCS is a tool that allows users to track changes in the content. It keeps track of various changes made
                to the content as people and multiple teams collaborate.
                In layman terms, Think of the content as a book you and your friend are writing together, you both come
                with different ideas for the arc of your character and make various versions of the story over time as
                characters increase so does multiple storylines, it would be a nightmare to keep everything in order,
                this is where VCS comes into play, it keeps track of following things
                -What changes were made?
                -Who made the changes?
                -When were the changes made?</p>
            <p>If you want to go back to the storyline where your protagonist doesn’t die, you can just revert to it.
                You can <strong><em>Merge</em></strong> your friend’s ideas into your version. If someone screws up, he
                can just compare with the previous versions and rectify the mistake without disturbing the others.</p>
            <p><strong>Repository</strong> - It is like a folder for your project’s files. It contains all of your
                project files and their detailed history.</p>
            <h3 id="-distributed-version-control-system-dvcs-"><strong>Distributed Version Control System
                    (DVCS)</strong></h3>
            <p>DVCS means that the code isn’t just hosted on a single server or system but also distributed across
                various systems. This means that each developer has a copy of the code on his local system.
                Git has a remote repository stored on a server and a local repository stored on the developer’s
                computer. Developers don’t need a constant central connection to the remote repository and can
                collaborate suiting their timetable. Each developer has a transparent history of changes, who made the
                changes and when.
                So now we have the basic introduction of Git, let’s look at GitHub.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1 id="what-is-github-">What is GitHub?</h1>
            <p>I read the following line somewhere on the internet and to me; it is one of the best definitions for
                GitHub.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“<em>What Pornhub is to Porn, GitHub is to Git</em>”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Jokes apart think of it in this way, when you use git locally you can only manage your local code but
                that is rarely the case, mostly you have to collaborate with other people or teams and for that, you
                need to have a remote repository setup on the cloud, here GitHub fits in.</p>
            <p>GitHub is a git hosting repository service, but it adds many of its features to the core git. Git is a
                command-line tool but GitHub is an interactive website that also allows some unique features on top of
                Git like GitHub Flow (Sounds like an excellent idea for the next post). There is a community of over 15
                million developers on GitHub.</p>
            <h2 id="how-to-create-your-first-repo">How to Create your First Repo</h2>
            <p>Are you excited to create your first repository from scratch?
                But first, install git on your system from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a> and create a
                GitHub account if you haven’t.</p>
            <p>Let’s Begin Now!!</p>
            <p>Important: <em>The following instructions are for bash terminal</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a directory for your project using the <em>mkdir</em> command</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">mkdir</span> firstProject
  </code></pre>
            <ul>
                <li>Go into the new directory</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>cd .<span class="hljs-regexp">/firstProject/</span>
  </code></pre>
            <ul>
                <li>Initialize the Git repo using git init</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">git init</span>
  </code></pre>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a file now</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>echo “This <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">my</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">first</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">text</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">file</span>” &gt; readme.md
  </code></pre>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the files to git. After this command, the Git will keep track of the changes made to the file.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>git <span class="hljs-keyword">add</span><span class="bash"> readme.md</span>
  </code></pre>
            <ul>
                <li>Commit (save) the changes to git, the command tells to save the changes along with the message
                    “initial commit”</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>git <span class="hljs-keyword">commit</span> -m “<span class="hljs-keyword">initial</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">commit</span>”
  </code></pre>
            <p>You now have a local git repository. You can use it locally, but I would rather host it on my GitHub.</p>
            <h1 id="connecting-it-to-github">Connecting it to GitHub</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to GitHub,</li>
                <li>Sign in to your account</li>
                <li>Click on the new repository button (Hint: It has a green background)</li>
                <li>Enter the repo’s name “<em>firstProject</em>”</li>
                <li>Click Create Repository
                    You would see sets of instructions on the page, follow the second one -<em>or push an existing
                        repository...</em>
                    <pre><code>git remote <span class="hljs-keyword">add</span><span class="bash"> origin https://github.com/yourUsername/firstProject.git
  </span>git push -u origin master
  </code></pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The first command adds the remote address of the repository to the Git and the second command tells the
                system to push (send) local repo to the remote origin repo.</p>
            <p>Voila!! You have successfully hosted your first repo on GitHub.Give yourself a treat today, you deserve
                it.</p>
            <p>This is my first post on any platform, so kindly share your reviews and suggestions in the comments. I
                would very much like to improve. I guess we all learned something today.</p>
